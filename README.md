The colour palettes have been chosen to show only 15 colours; if the palette is made up of fewer colours, then all the colours are present. The palettes are taken from the R database and the paletteer, RColorBrewer and wesanderson packages. The paletteer discrete palettes have their own file, not coloured in Excel, because there are too many cells to colour.
