# Colors codes in R
## Find the RGB and HEX codes for all named colors in R and ggplot2 --> colors_codes_in_R
## Same for palette colors --> palettes_codes_in_R
### Sheets are colored according to the... color, for a better visualization
The colour palettes have been chosen to show only 15 colours; if the palette is made up of fewer colours, then all the colours are present. The palettes are taken from the R database and the paletteer, RColorBrewer and wesanderson packages. The paletteer discrete palettes have their own file, not coloured in Excel, because there are too many cells to colour.
you can find the R code for colors codes extraction and Excel cell coloration for more details or adaptation
